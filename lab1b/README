lab1b

This program creates a multi-process telnet-like client and server terminal where data is communicated over a TCP socket connection.

USAGE

	lab1b-client -[e] -[l] filename -[p] portno
	lab1b-server -[e] -[p] portno

-p : indicates connection port number
-l : logs all communication between client and server into specified filename
-e : encrypts all communication between client and server


lab1b-client.c
This contains the source code for the client program.

lab1b-server.c
This contains the source code for the server program.

Makefile
This allows the user to compile the program, create a distributable, or remove the program.

Makefile Options
Using make on its own will compile both lab1b-client.c and lab1b-client.c.
  dist: using make dist will create a tarball containing the lab1b program files
  clean: using make clean will remove all files previously created using this makefile and return it to its untared state

my.key
This contains the encryption key used by the client and server programs.
